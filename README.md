# create-fake-user-agent

One of the biggest issues with user agents is that they're very easy to flag, especially if you're using an already suspicious IP address. This simple function creates a random user agent that, while unknown, will not raise any suspicions because it'll be only used once!

Examples:
{'User-Agent': 'veyeramo/0.3 (http://veyeramo.io)'}  
{'User-Agent': 'miruki/1.0 (http://miruki.net)'}  
{'User-Agent': 'jixibaxuziro/2.8 (http://jixibaxuziro.com)'}
